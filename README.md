This model will help the company for offering competetive pay to existing and future employees while also keeping payroll expenses in check.

Data transformation and machine learning will be used to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type, college degree, college major, industry, and miles from a metropolis.

The data for this model is relatively simplified as it has very few missing areas. The raw data consists of a dataset with the features listed above and their corresponding salaries. Twenty percent of this dataset was split into a test dataset with corresponding salaries so accuracy and error of the model can be determined.
